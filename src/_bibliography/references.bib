  abstract    = {{Cheese taste and flavour properties result from complex metabolic processes occurring in microbial communities. A deeper understanding of such mechanisms makes it possible to improve both industrial production processes and end-product quality through the design of microbial consortia. In this work, we caracterise the metabolism of a three-species community consisting of Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus plantarum and Propionibacterium freudenreichii during a seven-week cheese production process. Using genome-scale metabolic models and omics data integration, we modeled and calibrated individual dynamics using monoculture experiments, and coupled these models to capture the metabolism of the community. This model accurately predicts the dynamics of the community, enlightening the contribution of each microbial species to organoleptic compound production. Further metabolic exploration revealed additional possible interactions between the bacterial species. This work provides a methodological framework for the prediction of community-wide metabolism and highlights the added value of dynamic metabolic modeling for the comprehension of fermented food processes.}},

  abstract = {{Building models is essential for understanding the functions and dynamics of microbial communities. Metabolic models built on genome‐scale metabolic network reconstructions (GENREs) are especially relevant as a means to decipher the complex interactions occurring among species. Model reconstruction increasingly relies on metagenomics, which permits direct characterisation of naturally occurring communities that may contain organisms that cannot be isolated or cultured. In this review, we provide an overview of the field of metabolic modelling and its increasing reliance on and synergy with metagenomics and bioinformatics. We survey the means of assigning functions and reconstructing metabolic networks from (meta‐)genomes, and present the variety and mathematical fundamentals of metabolic models that foster the understanding of microbial dynamics. We emphasise the characterisation of interactions and the scaling of model construction to large communities, two important bottlenecks in the applicability of these models. We give an overview of the current state of the art in metagenome sequencing and bioinformatics analysis, focusing on the reconstruction of genomes in microbial communities. Metagenomics benefits tremendously from third‐generation sequencing, and we discuss the opportunities of long‐read sequencing, strain‐level characterisation and eukaryotic metagenomics. We aim at providing algorithmic and mathematical support, together with tool and application resources, that permit bridging the gap between metagenomics and metabolic modelling. With this review we articulate two important topics in the context of deciphering the role and functions of microbial communities: metabolic modeling and metagenomics. We survey the methodological approaches, highlight the changes raised by third generation sequencing, and provide resources to bridge the gaps between the sequencing reads and the models.}},

    abstract = {{The human gut microbiome composition is generally in a stable dynamic equilibrium, but it can deteriorate into dysbiotic states detrimental to host health. To disentangle the inherent complexity and capture the ecological spectrum of microbiome variability, we used 5,230 gut metagenomes to characterize signatures of bacteria commonly co-occurring, termed enterosignatures (ESs). We find five generalizable ESs dominated by either Bacteroides, Firmicutes, Prevotella, Bifidobacterium, or Escherichia. This model confirms key ecological characteristics known from previous enterotype concepts, while enabling the detection of gradual shifts in community structures. Temporal analysis implies that the Bacteroides-associated ES is “core” in the resilience of westernized gut microbiomes, while combinations with other ESs often complement the functional spectrum. The model reliably detects atypical gut microbiomes correlated with adverse host health conditions and/or the presence of pathobionts. ESs provide an interpretable and generic model that enables an intuitive characterization of gut microbiome composition in health and disease.}},

However, it is impeded by the high heterogeneity of the quality and completeness of structural and functional genome annotations, which may bias the results of such comparisons. To address this issue, we developed AuCoMe, a pipeline to automatically reconstruct homogeneous GSMNs from a heterogeneous set of annotated genomes without discarding available manual annotations. We tested AuCoMe with three data sets, one bacterial, one fungal, and one algal, and showed that it successfully reduces technical biases while capturing the metabolic specificities of each organism. Our results also point out shared and divergent metabolic traits among evolutionarily distant algae, underlining the potential of AuCoMe to accelerate the broad exploration of metabolic evolution across the tree of life.}},

    abstract = {{Microbes can modify their hosts’ stress tolerance, thus potentially enhancing their ecological range. An example of such interactions is Ectocarpus subulatus, one of the few freshwater‐tolerant brown algae. This tolerance is partially due to its (un)cultivated microbiome. We investigated this phenomenon by modifying the microbiome of laboratory‐grown E. subulatus using mild antibiotic treatments, which affected its ability to grow in low salinity. Low salinity acclimation of these algal‐bacterial associations was then compared. Salinity significantly impacted bacterial and viral gene expression, albeit in different ways across algal‐bacterial communities. In contrast, gene expression of the host and metabolite profiles were affected almost exclusively in the freshwater‐intolerant algal‐bacterial communities. We found no evidence of bacterial protein production that would directly improve algal stress tolerance. However, vitamin K synthesis is one possible bacterial service missing specifically in freshwater‐intolerant cultures in low salinity. In this condition, we also observed a relative increase in bacterial transcriptomic activity and the induction of microbial genes involved in the biosynthesis of the autoinducer AI‐1, a quorum‐sensing regulator. This could have resulted in dysbiosis by causing a shift in bacterial behavior in the intolerant algal‐bacterial community. Together, these results provide two promising hypotheses to be examined by future targeted experiments. Although they apply only to the specific study system, they offer an example of how bacteria may impact their host's stress response.}},

    abstract = {{European grapevine is a complex holobiont composed of two plant genomes, that of the scion (Vitis vinifera L.) and the rootstock (Vitis spp.), and a multitude of microbial genomes that collectively form the microbiome. The grapevine microbiome has been extensively described over the last decade, primarily using metabarcoding approaches. Unfortunately, metabarcoding data alone provide little information on microbial functions and outcomes of plant-microbe interactions. Here we review knowledge about the microorganisms that have a demonstrated influence, positive or negative, on the performance of the grapevine holobiont. Our review encompasses bacteria, filamentous fungi, yeasts, oomycetes and viruses. It covers aboveground and belowground microorganisms, including arbuscular mycorrhizal and ectomycorrhizal fungi. We focus on taxa and functions that protect the plant against pathogens and pests, promote growth, increase tolerance to abiotic stresses and highlight those involved in disease and decline. As the outcomes of plant-microbe interactions are labile, we examine the dynamics and functions of grapevine-microbiome interactions over both the plant lifetime and the plant evolutionary history, beginning with plant domestication. Based on the knowledge and gaps we identify, we suggest field sampling designs, culture-based experiments, molecular tools and theoretical analysis methods, including shotgun metagenomics and network models, that could be used in future research to uncover and leverage the full functional potential of the grapevine microbiome.}},

    abstract       = {{Mathematical and numerical models are increasingly used in microbial ecology to model the fate of microbial communities in their ecosystem. These models allow to connect in a mechanistic framework species-level informations, such as the microbial genomes, with macro-scale features, such as species spatial distributions or metabolite gradients. Numerous models are built upon species-level metabolic models that predict the metabolic behaviour of a microbe by solving an optimization problem knowing its genome and its nutritional environment. However, screening the community dynamics with these metabolic models implies to solve such an optimization problem by species at each time step, leading to a significant computational load further increased by several orders of magnitude when spatial dimensions are added. In this paper, we propose a statistical framework based on Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) metamodels that are used to provide fast approximations of the original metabolic model. The metamodel can replace the optimization step in the system dynamics, providing comparable outputs at a much lower computational cost. We will first build a system dynamics model of a simplified gut microbiota composed of a unique commensal bacterial strain in interaction with the host and challenged by a Salmonella infection. Then, the machine learning method will be introduced, and particularly the ANOVA-RKHS that will be exploited to achieve variable selection and model parsimony. A training dataset will be constructed with the original system dynamics model and hyper-parameters will be carefully chosen to provide fast and accurate approximations of the original model. Finally, the accuracy of the trained metamodels will be assessed, in particular by comparing the system dynamics outputs when the original model is replaced by its metamodel. The metamodel allows an overall relative error of 4.71\% but reducing the computational load by a speed-up factor higher than 45, while correctly reproducing the complex behaviour occurring during Salmonella infection. These results provide a proof-of-concept of the potentiality of machine learning methods to give fast approximations of metabolic model outputs and pave the way towards PDE-based spatio-temporal models of microbial communities including microbial metabolism and host-microbiota-pathogen interactions.}},

    abstract = {{Animals, plants, and algae rely on symbiotic microorganisms for their development and functioning. Genome sequencing and genomic analyses of these microorganisms provide opportunities to construct metabolic networks and to analyze the metabolism of the symbiotic communities they constitute. Genome-scale metabolic network reconstructions rest on information gained from genome annotation. As there are multiple annotation pipelines available, the question arises to what extent differences in annotation pipelines impact outcomes of these analyses. Here, we compare five commonly used pipelines (Prokka, MaGe, IMG, DFAST, RAST) from predicted annotation features (coding sequences, Enzyme Commission numbers, hypothetical proteins) to the metabolic network-based analysis of symbiotic communities (biochemical reactions, producible compounds, and selection of minimal complementary bacterial communities). While Prokka and IMG produced the most extensive networks, RAST and DFAST networks produced the fewest false positives and the most connected networks with the fewest dead-end metabolites. Our results underline differences between the outputs of the tested pipelines at all examined levels, with small differences in the draft metabolic networks resulting in the selection of different microbial consortia to expand the metabolic capabilities of the algal host. However, the consortia generated yielded similar predicted producible compounds and could therefore be considered functionally interchangeable. This contrast between selected communities and community functions depending on the annotation pipeline needs to be taken into consideration when interpreting the results of metabolic complementarity analyses. In the future, experimental validation of bioinformatic predictions will likely be crucial to both evaluate and refine the pipelines and needs to be coupled with increased efforts to expand and improve annotations in reference databases.}},

These “tenacious” bacteria show high levels of genetic adaptation to the human host but a high probability of loss upon antibiotic interventions. By contrast, heredipersistent bacteria, notably Firmicutes, often rely on dispersal strategies with weak phylogeographic patterns but strong family transmissions, likely related to sporulation.

However, functional annotations and estimating metabolic processes from single species – or communities – is still challenging. Earlier approaches relied mostly on inferring the presence of key enzymes for metabolic pathways in the whole metagenome, ignoring the genomic context of such enzymes, resulting in the ‘bag-of-genes’ approach to estimate functional capacities of microbiotas. Here, we review recent developments in metagenomic bioinformatics, with a special focus on emerging technologies to simulate and estimate metabolic information, that can be derived from metagenomic assembled genomes. Genome-scale metabolic models can be used to model the emergent properties of microbial consortia and whole communities, and the progress in this area is reviewed. While this subfield of metagenomics is still in its infancy, it is becoming evident that there is a dire need for further bioinformatic tools to address the complex combinatorial problems in modelling the metabolism of large communities as a ‘bag-of-genomes’.}},

Despite close interactions between animals, plants, their associated microbiomes, and the environment they inhabit, the distribution and role of bacteria and especially fungi across host and environments as well as the cross‐habitat determinants of their community compositions remain little investigated. Using a uniquely broad global dataset of 13,483 metagenomes, we analyzed the microbiome structure and function of 25 host‐associated and environmental habitats, focusing on potential interactions between bacteria and fungi. We found that the metagenomic relative abundance ratio of bacteria‐to‐fungi is a distinctive microbial feature of habitats. Compared to fungi, the cross‐habitat distribution pattern of bacteria was more strongly driven by habitat type. Fungal diversity was depleted in host‐associated communities compared with those in the environment, particularly terrestrial habitats, whereas this diversity pattern was less pronounced for bacteria. The relative gene functional potential of bacteria or fungi reflected their diversity patterns and appeared to depend on a balance between substrate availability and biotic interactions. Alongside helping to identify hotspots and sources of microbial diversity, our study provides support for differences in assembly patterns and processes between bacterial and fungal communities across different habitats.

    abstract = {{Systems modelled in the context of molecular and cellular biology are difficult to represent with a single calibrated numerical model. Flux optimisation hypotheses have shown tremendous promise to accurately predict bacterial metabolism but they require a precise understanding of metabolic reactions occurring in the considered species. Unfortunately, this information may not be available for more complex organisms or non-cultured microorganisms such as those evidenced in microbiomes with metagenomic techniques. In both cases, flux optimisation techniques may not be applicable to elucidate systems functioning. In this context, we describe how automatic reasoning allows relevant features of an unconventional biological system to be identified despite a lack of data. A particular focus is put on the use of Answer Set Programming, a logic programming paradigm with combinatorial optimisation functionalities. We describe its usage to over-approximate metabolic responses of biological systems and solve gap-filling problems. In this review, we compare steady-states and Boolean abstractions of metabolic models and illustrate their complementarity via applications to the metabolic analysis of macro-algae. Ongoing applications of this formalism explore the emerging field of systems ecology, notably elucidating interactions between a consortium of microbes and a host organism. As the first step in this field, we will illustrate how the reduction in microbiotas according to expected metabolic phenotypes can be addressed with gap-filling problems.}},

    abstract = {Brown algae are multicellular photosynthetic stramenopiles that colonize marine rocky shores worldwide. Ectocarpus sp. Ec32 has been established as a genomic model for brown algae. Here we present the genome and metabolic network of the closely related species, Ectocarpus subulatus K{\"{u}}tzing, which is characterized by high abiotic stress tolerance. Since their separation, both strains show new traces of viral sequences and the activity of large retrotransposons, which may also be related to the expansion of a family of chlorophyll-binding proteins. Further features suspected to contribute to stress tolerance include an expanded family of heat shock proteins, the reduction of genes involved in the production of halogenated defence compounds, and the presence of fewer cell wall polysaccharide-modifying enzymes. Overall, E. subulatus has mainly lost members of gene families down-regulated in low salinities, and conserved those that were up-regulated in the same condition. However, 96{\%} of genes that differed between the two examined Ectocarpus species, as well as all genes under positive selection, were found to encode proteins of unknown function. This underlines the uniqueness of brown algal stress tolerance mechanisms as well as the significance of establishing E. subulatus as a comparative model for future functional studies.},

    abstract = {Brown algae are key components of marine ecosystems and live in association with bacteria that are essential for their growth and development. Ectocarpus siliculosus is a genetic and genomic model for brown algae. Here we use this model to start disentangling the complex interactions that may occur between the algal host and its associated bacteria. We report the genome-sequencing of 10 alga-associated bacteria and the genome-based reconstruction of their metabolic networks. The predicted metabolic capacities were then used to identify metabolic complementarities between the algal host and the bacteria, highlighting a range of potentially beneficial metabolite exchanges between them. These putative exchanges allowed us to predict consortia consisting of a subset of these ten bacteria that would best complement the algal metabolism. Finally, co-culture experiments were set up with a subset of these consortia to monitor algal growth as well as the presence of key algal metabolites. Although we did not fully control but only modified bacterial communities in our experiments, our data demonstrated a significant increase in algal growth in cultures inoculated with the selected consortia. In several cases, we also detected, in algal extracts, the presence of key metabolites predicted to become producible via an exchange of metabolites between the alga and the microbiome. Thus, although further methodological developments will be necessary to better control and understand microbial interactions in Ectocarpus, our data suggest that metabolic complementarity is a good indicator of beneficial metabolite exchanges in the holobiont.},

    abstract = {Understanding growth mechanisms in brown algae is a current scientific and economic challenge that can benefit from the modeling of their metabolic networks. The sequencing of the genomes of Saccharina japonica and Cladosiphon okamuranus has provided the necessary data for the reconstruction of Genome–Scale Metabolic Networks (GSMNs). The same in silico method deployed for the GSMN reconstruction of Ectocarpus siliculosus to investigate the metabolic capabilities of these two algae, was used. Integrating metabolic profiling data from the literature, we provided functional GSMNs composed of an average of 2230 metabolites and 3370 reactions. Based on these GSMNs and previously published work, we propose a model for the biosynthetic pathways of the main carotenoids in these two algae. We highlight, on the one hand, the reactions and enzymes that have been preserved through evolution and, on the other hand, the specificities related to brown algae. Our data further indicate that, if abscisic acid is produced by Saccharina japonica, its biosynthesis pathway seems to be different in its final steps from that described in land plants. Thus, our work illustrates the potential of GSMNs reconstructions for formalizing hypotheses that can be further tested using targeted biochemical approaches.},

Building good models requires the integration of all relevant available information, obtained by exploring different data types and biological databases. This process is not straightforward and choices are made along the way, for example, which data is analyzed, with what tools. It matters that all reconstruction steps are well documented so that models can be fully exploited by the community. Having this metadata allows other researchers to reproduce, improve or reuse a model as a blueprint to create new ones. Sadly, this information is usually scattered and its proper distribution is the exception rather than the norm when using “à la carte” pipelines that combine main platforms and individual tools. We created a platform for “à la carte” metabolic model generation that responds to the need of transparency and data-connection in the field. It includes a battery of tools to exploit heterogeneous data through customizable pipelines. At each step, relevant information is stored, ensuring reproducibility and documentation of processes. Furthermore, exploration of models and metadata during the reconstruction process is facilitated through the automatic generation of local wikis. This view offers a user-friendly solution to iteratively explore genome-scale metabolic models produced with personalized pipelines and poorly interoperable tools. We highlight these benefits by building models for organisms with various input data. Among them, we show why the combination of heterogeneous information is necessary to elucidate specificities of Tisochrysis lutea, a eukaryotic microalga, for anti-oxidant production.},

    abstract = {Metabolic networks play a crucial role in biology since they capture all chemical reactions in an organism. While there are networks of high quality for many model organisms, networks for less studied organisms are often of poor quality and suffer from incompleteness. To this end, we introduced in previous work an answer set programming (ASP)-based approach to metabolic network completion. Although this qualitative approach allows for restoring moderately degraded networks, it fails to restore highly degraded ones. This is because it ignores quantitative constraints capturing reaction rates. To address this problem, we propose a hybrid approach to metabolic network completion that integrates our qualitative ASP approach with quantitative means for capturing reaction rates. We begin by formally reconciling existing stoichiometric and topological approaches to network completion in a unified formalism. With it, we develop a hybrid ASP encoding and rely upon the theory reasoning capacities of the ASP system clingo for solving the resulting logic program with linear constraints over reals. We empirically evaluate our approach by means of the metabolic network of Escherichia coli . Our analysis shows that our novel approach yields greatly superior results than obtainable from purely qualitative or quantitative approaches.},

    abstract = {Systems biology relies on computational biology to integrate knowledge and data, for a better understanding of organisms' physiology. Challenges reside in the applicability of methods and tools to non-model organisms, for instance in marine biology. Sequencing advances and the growing importance of elucidating microbiotas' roles, have led to an increased interest into these organisms. This thesis focuses on the modeling of the metabolism through networks, and of its functionality using graphs and constraints semantics. In particular, a first part presents work on gap-filling metabolic networks in the context of non-model organisms. A graph-based method is benchmarked and validated and a hybrid one is developed using Answer Set Programming (ASP) and linear programming. Such gap-filling is applied on algae and extended to decipher putative interactions between Ectocarpus siliculosus and a symbiotic bacterium. In this direction, the second part of the thesis aims at proposing formalisms and implementation of a tool for selecting and screening communities of interest within microbiotas. It enables to scale to large microbiotas and, with a two-step approach, to suggest symbionts that fit the desired objective. The modeling supports the computation of exchanges, and solving can cover the whole solution space. Applications are presented on the human gut microbiota and the selection of bacterial communities for a brown alga. Altogether, this thesis proposes modeling, software and biological applications using graph-based semantics to support the elaboration of hypotheses for elucidating the metabolism of organisms.},
