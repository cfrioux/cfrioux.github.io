@article{Dittami2020,
    abstract = {Brown algae are multicellular photosynthetic stramenopiles that colonize marine rocky shores worldwide. Ectocarpus sp. Ec32 has been established as a genomic model for brown algae. Here we present the genome and metabolic network of the closely related species, Ectocarpus subulatus K{\"{u}}tzing, which is characterized by high abiotic stress tolerance. Since their separation, both strains show new traces of viral sequences and the activity of large retrotransposons, which may also be related to the expansion of a family of chlorophyll-binding proteins. Further features suspected to contribute to stress tolerance include an expanded family of heat shock proteins, the reduction of genes involved in the production of halogenated defence compounds, and the presence of fewer cell wall polysaccharide-modifying enzymes. Overall, E. subulatus has mainly lost members of gene families down-regulated in low salinities, and conserved those that were up-regulated in the same condition. However, 96{\%} of genes that differed between the two examined Ectocarpus species, as well as all genes under positive selection, were found to encode proteins of unknown function. This underlines the uniqueness of brown algal stress tolerance mechanisms as well as the significance of establishing E. subulatus as a comparative model for future functional studies.},

    abstract = {Understanding growth mechanisms in brown algae is a current scientific and economic challenge that can benefit from the modeling of their metabolic networks. The sequencing of the genomes of Saccharina japonica and Cladosiphon okamuranus has provided the necessary data for the reconstruction of Genome–Scale Metabolic Networks (GSMNs). The same in silico method deployed for the GSMN reconstruction of Ectocarpus siliculosus to investigate the metabolic capabilities of these two algae, was used. Integrating metabolic profiling data from the literature, we provided functional GSMNs composed of an average of 2230 metabolites and 3370 reactions. Based on these GSMNs and previously published work, we propose a model for the biosynthetic pathways of the main carotenoids in these two algae. We highlight, on the one hand, the reactions and enzymes that have been preserved through evolution and, on the other hand, the specificities related to brown algae. Our data further indicate that, if abscisic acid is produced by Saccharina japonica, its biosynthesis pathway seems to be different in its final steps from that described in land plants. Thus, our work illustrates the potential of GSMNs reconstructions for formalizing hypotheses that can be further tested using targeted biochemical approaches.},

@article{Burgunter-Delamare2020,
    abstract = {Brown algae are key components of marine ecosystems and live in association with bacteria that are essential for their growth and development. Ectocarpus siliculosus is a genetic and genomic model for brown algae. Here we use this model to start disentangling the complex interactions that may occur between the algal host and its associated bacteria. We report the genome-sequencing of 10 alga-associated bacteria and the genome-based reconstruction of their metabolic networks. The predicted metabolic capacities were then used to identify metabolic complementarities between the algal host and the bacteria, highlighting a range of potentially beneficial metabolite exchanges between them. These putative exchanges allowed us to predict consortia consisting of a subset of these ten bacteria that would best complement the algal metabolism. Finally, co-culture experiments were set up with a subset of these consortia to monitor algal growth as well as the presence of key algal metabolites. Although we did not fully control but only modified bacterial communities in our experiments, our data demonstrated a significant increase in algal growth in cultures inoculated with the selected consortia. In several cases, we also detected, in algal extracts, the presence of key metabolites predicted to become producible via an exchange of metabolites between the alga and the microbiome. Thus, although further methodological developments will be necessary to better control and understand microbial interactions in Ectocarpus, our data suggest that metabolic complementarity is a good indicator of beneficial metabolite exchanges in the holobiont.},

    abstract = {Author summary Genome-scale metabolic models describe an organism’s metabolism. Building good models requires the integration of all relevant available information, obtained by exploring different data types and biological databases. This process is not straightforward and choices are made along the way, for example, which data is analyzed, with what tools. It matters that all reconstruction steps are well documented so that models can be fully exploited by the community. Having this metadata allows other researchers to reproduce, improve or reuse a model as a blueprint to create new ones. Sadly, this information is usually scattered and its proper distribution is the exception rather than the norm when using “à la carte” pipelines that combine main platforms and individual tools. We created a platform for “à la carte” metabolic model generation that responds to the need of transparency and data-connection in the field. It includes a battery of tools to exploit heterogeneous data through customizable pipelines. At each step, relevant information is stored, ensuring reproducibility and documentation of processes. Furthermore, exploration of models and metadata during the reconstruction process is facilitated through the automatic generation of local wikis. This view offers a user-friendly solution to iteratively explore genome-scale metabolic models produced with personalized pipelines and poorly interoperable tools. We highlight these benefits by building models for organisms with various input data. Among them, we show why the combination of heterogeneous information is necessary to elucidate specificities of Tisochrysis lutea, a eukaryotic microalga, for anti-oxidant production.},

@article{Frioux2019,
    abstract = {Metabolic networks play a crucial role in biology since they capture all chemical reactions in an organism. While there are networks of high quality for many model organisms, networks for less studied organisms are often of poor quality and suffer from incompleteness. To this end, we introduced in previous work an answer set programming (ASP)-based approach to metabolic network completion. Although this qualitative approach allows for restoring moderately degraded networks, it fails to restore highly degraded ones. This is because it ignores quantitative constraints capturing reaction rates. To address this problem, we propose a hybrid approach to metabolic network completion that integrates our qualitative ASP approach with quantitative means for capturing reaction rates. We begin by formally reconciling existing stoichiometric and topological approaches to network completion in a unified formalism. With it, we develop a hybrid ASP encoding and rely upon the theory reasoning capacities of the ASP system clingo for solving the resulting logic program with linear constraints over reals. We empirically evaluate our approach by means of the metabolic network of Escherichia coli . Our analysis shows that our novel approach yields greatly superior results than obtainable from purely qualitative or quantitative approaches.},

    abstract = {Systems biology relies on computational biology to integrate knowledge and data, for a better understanding of organisms' physiology. Challenges reside in the applicability of methods and tools to non-model organisms, for instance in marine biology. Sequencing advances and the growing importance of elucidating microbiotas' roles, have led to an increased interest into these organisms. This thesis focuses on the modeling of the metabolism through networks, and of its functionality using graphs and constraints semantics. In particular, a first part presents work on gap-filling metabolic networks in the context of non-model organisms. A graph-based method is benchmarked and validated and a hybrid one is developed using Answer Set Programming (ASP) and linear programming. Such gap-filling is applied on algae and extended to decipher putative interactions between Ectocarpus siliculosus and a symbiotic bacterium. In this direction, the second part of the thesis aims at proposing formalisms and implementation of a tool for selecting and screening communities of interest within microbiotas. It enables to scale to large microbiotas and, with a two-step approach, to suggest symbionts that fit the desired objective. The modeling supports the computation of exchanges, and solving can cover the whole solution space. Applications are presented on the human gut microbiota and the selection of bacterial communities for a brown alga. Altogether, this thesis proposes modeling, software and biological applications using graph-based semantics to support the elaboration of hypotheses for elucidating the metabolism of organisms.},

    abstract = {Capturing the functional diversity of microbiotas entails identifying metabolic functions and species of interest within hundreds or thousands. Starting from genomes, a way to functionally analyse genetic information is to build metabolic networks. Yet, no method enables a functional screening of such a large number of metabolic networks nor the identification of critical species with respect to metabolic cooperation. Metage2Metabo (M2M) addresses scalability issues raised by metagenomics datasets to identify keystone, essential and alternative symbionts in large microbiotas communities with respect to individual metabolism and collective metabolic complementarity. Genome-scale metabolic networks for the community can be either provided by the user or very efficiently reconstructed from a large family of genomes thanks to a multi-processing solution to run the Pathway Tools software. The pipeline was applied to 1,520 genomes from the gut microbiota and 913 metagenome-assembled genomes of the rumen microbiota. Reconstruction of metabolic networks and subsequent metabolic analyses were performed in a reasonable time. M2M identifies keystone, essential and alternative organisms by reducing the complexity of a large-scale microbiota into minimal communities with equivalent properties, suitable for further analyses. * M2M : metage2metabo GSMN : Genome-Scale Metabolic Network MAG : Metagenome-Assembled Genome GFF : Generic Feature Format RAM : Random-Access Memory PGDB : Pathway Genome DataBase SBML : Systems Biology Markup Language GUI : Graphical User Interface PN : Power Node},
