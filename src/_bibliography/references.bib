    abstract = {{To capture the functional diversity of microbiota, one must identify metabolic functions and species of interest within hundreds or thousands of microorganisms. We present Metage2Metabo (M2M) a resource that meets the need for de-novo functional screening of genome-scale metabolic networks (GSMNs) at the scale of a metagenome, and the identification of critical species with respect to metabolic cooperation. M2M comprises a flexible pipeline for the characterisation of individual metabolisms and collective metabolic complementarity. In addition, M2M identifies key species, that are meaningful members of the community for functions of interest. We demonstrate that M2M is applicable to collections of genomes as well as metagenome-assembled genomes, permits an efficient GSMN reconstruction with Pathway Tools, and assesses the cooperation potential between species. M2M identifies key organisms by reducing the complexity of a large-scale microbiota into minimal communities with equivalent properties, suitable for further analyses.}},

    abstract = {{ Metagenomic sequencing of complete microbial communities has greatly enhanced our understanding of the taxonomic composition of microbiotas. This has led to breakthrough developments in bioinformatic disciplines such as assembly, gene clustering, metagenomic binning of species genomes and the discovery of an incredible, so far undiscovered, taxonomic diversity. However, functional annotations and estimating metabolic processes from single species – or communities – is still challenging. Earlier approaches relied mostly on inferring the presence of key enzymes for metabolic pathways in the whole metagenome, ignoring the genomic context of such enzymes, resulting in the ‘bag-of-genes’ approach to estimate functional capacities of microbiotas. Here, we review recent developments in metagenomic bioinformatics, with a special focus on emerging technologies to simulate and estimate metabolic information, that can be derived from metagenomic assembled genomes. Genome-scale metabolic models can be used to model the emergent properties of microbial consortia and whole communities, and the progress in this area is reviewed. While this subfield of metagenomics is still in its infancy, it is becoming evident that there is a dire need for further bioinformatic tools to address the complex combinatorial problems in modelling the metabolism of large communities as a ‘bag-of-genomes’.}},

    abstract = {{Bacteria and fungi are of uttermost importance in determining environmental and host functioning. Despite close interactions between animals, plants, their associated microbiomes, and the environment they inhabit, the distribution and role of bacteria and especially fungi across host and environments as well as the cross‐habitat determinants of their community compositions remain little investigated. Using a uniquely broad global dataset of 13,483 metagenomes, we analyzed the microbiome structure and function of 25 host‐associated and environmental habitats, focusing on potential interactions between bacteria and fungi. We found that the metagenomic relative abundance ratio of bacteria‐to‐fungi is a distinctive microbial feature of habitats. Compared to fungi, the cross‐habitat distribution pattern of bacteria was more strongly driven by habitat type. Fungal diversity was depleted in host‐associated communities compared with those in the environment, particularly terrestrial habitats, whereas this diversity pattern was less pronounced for bacteria. The relative gene functional potential of bacteria or fungi reflected their diversity patterns and appeared to depend on a balance between substrate availability and biotic interactions. Alongside helping to identify hotspots and sources of microbial diversity, our study provides support for differences in assembly patterns and processes between bacterial and fungal communities across different habitats.

Flux optimisation hypotheses have shown tremendous promise to accurately predict bacterial metabolism but they require a precise understanding of metabolic reactions occurring in the considered species. Unfortunately, this information may not be available for more complex organisms or non-cultured microorganisms such as those evidenced in microbiomes with metagenomic techniques. In both cases, flux optimisation techniques may not be applicable to elucidate systems functioning. In this context, we describe how automatic reasoning allows relevant features of an unconventional biological system to be identified despite a lack of data. A particular focus is put on the use of Answer Set Programming, a logic programming paradigm with combinatorial optimisation functionalities. We describe its usage to over-approximate metabolic responses of biological systems and solve gap-filling problems. In this review, we compare steady-states and Boolean abstractions of metabolic models and illustrate their complementarity via applications to the metabolic analysis of macro-algae. Ongoing applications of this formalism explore the emerging field of systems ecology, notably elucidating interactions between a consortium of microbes and a host organism. As the first step in this field, we will illustrate how the reduction in microbiotas according to expected metabolic phenotypes can be addressed with gap-filling problems.}},

@article{Dittami2020,
    abstract = {Brown algae are multicellular photosynthetic stramenopiles that colonize marine rocky shores worldwide. Ectocarpus sp. Ec32 has been established as a genomic model for brown algae. Here we present the genome and metabolic network of the closely related species, Ectocarpus subulatus K{\"{u}}tzing, which is characterized by high abiotic stress tolerance. Since their separation, both strains show new traces of viral sequences and the activity of large retrotransposons, which may also be related to the expansion of a family of chlorophyll-binding proteins. Further features suspected to contribute to stress tolerance include an expanded family of heat shock proteins, the reduction of genes involved in the production of halogenated defence compounds, and the presence of fewer cell wall polysaccharide-modifying enzymes. Overall, E. subulatus has mainly lost members of gene families down-regulated in low salinities, and conserved those that were up-regulated in the same condition. However, 96{\%} of genes that differed between the two examined Ectocarpus species, as well as all genes under positive selection, were found to encode proteins of unknown function. This underlines the uniqueness of brown algal stress tolerance mechanisms as well as the significance of establishing E. subulatus as a comparative model for future functional studies.},

    abstract = {Brown algae are key components of marine ecosystems and live in association with bacteria that are essential for their growth and development. Ectocarpus siliculosus is a genetic and genomic model for brown algae. Here we use this model to start disentangling the complex interactions that may occur between the algal host and its associated bacteria. We report the genome-sequencing of 10 alga-associated bacteria and the genome-based reconstruction of their metabolic networks. The predicted metabolic capacities were then used to identify metabolic complementarities between the algal host and the bacteria, highlighting a range of potentially beneficial metabolite exchanges between them. These putative exchanges allowed us to predict consortia consisting of a subset of these ten bacteria that would best complement the algal metabolism. Finally, co-culture experiments were set up with a subset of these consortia to monitor algal growth as well as the presence of key algal metabolites. Although we did not fully control but only modified bacterial communities in our experiments, our data demonstrated a significant increase in algal growth in cultures inoculated with the selected consortia. In several cases, we also detected, in algal extracts, the presence of key metabolites predicted to become producible via an exchange of metabolites between the alga and the microbiome. Thus, although further methodological developments will be necessary to better control and understand microbial interactions in Ectocarpus, our data suggest that metabolic complementarity is a good indicator of beneficial metabolite exchanges in the holobiont.},

    abstract = {Understanding growth mechanisms in brown algae is a current scientific and economic challenge that can benefit from the modeling of their metabolic networks. The sequencing of the genomes of Saccharina japonica and Cladosiphon okamuranus has provided the necessary data for the reconstruction of Genome–Scale Metabolic Networks (GSMNs). The same in silico method deployed for the GSMN reconstruction of Ectocarpus siliculosus to investigate the metabolic capabilities of these two algae, was used. Integrating metabolic profiling data from the literature, we provided functional GSMNs composed of an average of 2230 metabolites and 3370 reactions. Based on these GSMNs and previously published work, we propose a model for the biosynthetic pathways of the main carotenoids in these two algae. We highlight, on the one hand, the reactions and enzymes that have been preserved through evolution and, on the other hand, the specificities related to brown algae. Our data further indicate that, if abscisic acid is produced by Saccharina japonica, its biosynthesis pathway seems to be different in its final steps from that described in land plants. Thus, our work illustrates the potential of GSMNs reconstructions for formalizing hypotheses that can be further tested using targeted biochemical approaches.},

Building good models requires the integration of all relevant available information, obtained by exploring different data types and biological databases. This process is not straightforward and choices are made along the way, for example, which data is analyzed, with what tools. It matters that all reconstruction steps are well documented so that models can be fully exploited by the community. Having this metadata allows other researchers to reproduce, improve or reuse a model as a blueprint to create new ones. Sadly, this information is usually scattered and its proper distribution is the exception rather than the norm when using “à la carte” pipelines that combine main platforms and individual tools. We created a platform for “à la carte” metabolic model generation that responds to the need of transparency and data-connection in the field. It includes a battery of tools to exploit heterogeneous data through customizable pipelines. At each step, relevant information is stored, ensuring reproducibility and documentation of processes. Furthermore, exploration of models and metadata during the reconstruction process is facilitated through the automatic generation of local wikis. This view offers a user-friendly solution to iteratively explore genome-scale metabolic models produced with personalized pipelines and poorly interoperable tools. We highlight these benefits by building models for organisms with various input data. Among them, we show why the combination of heterogeneous information is necessary to elucidate specificities of Tisochrysis lutea, a eukaryotic microalga, for anti-oxidant production.},

    abstract = {Metabolic networks play a crucial role in biology since they capture all chemical reactions in an organism. While there are networks of high quality for many model organisms, networks for less studied organisms are often of poor quality and suffer from incompleteness. To this end, we introduced in previous work an answer set programming (ASP)-based approach to metabolic network completion. Although this qualitative approach allows for restoring moderately degraded networks, it fails to restore highly degraded ones. This is because it ignores quantitative constraints capturing reaction rates. To address this problem, we propose a hybrid approach to metabolic network completion that integrates our qualitative ASP approach with quantitative means for capturing reaction rates. We begin by formally reconciling existing stoichiometric and topological approaches to network completion in a unified formalism. With it, we develop a hybrid ASP encoding and rely upon the theory reasoning capacities of the ASP system clingo for solving the resulting logic program with linear constraints over reals. We empirically evaluate our approach by means of the metabolic network of Escherichia coli . Our analysis shows that our novel approach yields greatly superior results than obtainable from purely qualitative or quantitative approaches.},

    abstract = {Systems biology relies on computational biology to integrate knowledge and data, for a better understanding of organisms' physiology. Challenges reside in the applicability of methods and tools to non-model organisms, for instance in marine biology. Sequencing advances and the growing importance of elucidating microbiotas' roles, have led to an increased interest into these organisms. This thesis focuses on the modeling of the metabolism through networks, and of its functionality using graphs and constraints semantics. In particular, a first part presents work on gap-filling metabolic networks in the context of non-model organisms. A graph-based method is benchmarked and validated and a hybrid one is developed using Answer Set Programming (ASP) and linear programming. Such gap-filling is applied on algae and extended to decipher putative interactions between Ectocarpus siliculosus and a symbiotic bacterium. In this direction, the second part of the thesis aims at proposing formalisms and implementation of a tool for selecting and screening communities of interest within microbiotas. It enables to scale to large microbiotas and, with a two-step approach, to suggest symbionts that fit the desired objective. The modeling supports the computation of exchanges, and solving can cover the whole solution space. Applications are presented on the human gut microbiota and the selection of bacterial communities for a brown alga. Altogether, this thesis proposes modeling, software and biological applications using graph-based semantics to support the elaboration of hypotheses for elucidating the metabolism of organisms.},
