    My most recent work is often not yet published but we present posters at conferences to share our results with the community. My most recent posters are not presented by me but rather by young researchers I (co-)supervise. A list of those posters can be found on <a href="https://inria.hal.science/search/index/?qa%5Bauth_t%5D%5B%5D=Cl%C3%A9mence+Frioux&rows=30&docType_s=POSTER">HAL</a>.
