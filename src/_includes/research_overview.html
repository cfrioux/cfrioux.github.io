    I am interested in solving <b>combinatorial optimisation problems</b> using <a href="https://potassco.org/" target="_blank">Answer Set Programming</a> in a computational biology context. Such logic programming paradigm can apply to modelling the metabolism of organisms. Metabolic networks are obtained by inferring the presence of metabolic reactions based on the genomic content of the associated organism. Such networks are the basis of models that can be simulated using various mathematical frameworks among which flux balance analysis (FBA) or network expansion. The latter is notably perfectly suited to logic programming and is implemented in many software systems that I developped (see below). As an example, the <a href="https://github.com/cfrioux/menetools" target="_blank"><i>Menetools</i></a> package includes several tools enabling dedicated to exploring the producibility potential of metabolic networks.

    Optimisation problems are numerous in the field of metabolic modelling. A first one that I worked on is the refinement of metabolic network or <b>gap-filling</b>. It aims at selecting a limited number of metabolic reactions from databases in order to ensure a metabolic objective is met by the metabolic model. This is the purpose of the Python package <a href="https://github.com/bioasp/meneco" target="_blank"><i>Meneco</i></a> (<i>PLOS Computational Biology 2017</i>).
    In addition to Meneco, I created, in collaboration with scientists of Potsdam University, a <b>hybrid</b> method for metabolic gap-filling, enabling the reconciliation of flux balance analysis and network expansion modellings. This work is implemented in <a href="https://github.com/cfrioux/fluto" target="_blank"><i>Fluto</i></a> (<i>LPNMR Conference 2017, best Student Paper, extended version of the manuscript in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming 2019</i>).

    I dedicated the past few years to applying optimisation problems and metabolic modelling to communities of organisms. <a href="https://github.com/cfrioux/miscoto" target="_blank"><i>MiSCoTo</i></a> is my first project on this topic. The underlying optimisation problem (<i>Bioinformatics 2018</i>) aims at <b>selecting minimal communities within a collection of metabolic networks</b> such that the selected communities meet a metabolic objective characterised by the producibility of metabolic compounds. MiSCoTo can in addition suggest metabolic exchanges that would be needed between the species of the selected communities.

    One of my latest projects if the development of <a href="https://github.com/AuReMe/metage2metabo" target="_blank"><i>Metage2Metabo</i></a> or M2M (<i>eLife 2020</i>), <b>an all-in-one workflow permitting the global analysis of a possibly large community of organisms in the context of microbiota</b>. M2M is a flexible pipeline with the following main steps: automation of metabolic network reconstruction with Pathway Tools, computation of individual and collective metabolic capabilities, estimation of the added-value of cooperation within the community, selection of minimal communities and <b>identification of key species</b> with respect to a metabolic objective.
